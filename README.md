# Security_Lock_in_Python


Hello guys!

Today, I have made a custom windows security lock.
So, This program contains the many features, it will ask for the username and password:
if the user enters current details then it will make access granted sound and log in to your system.
If user enters wrong details it will make access denied sound. however, after 3 times of wrong entry it will
shutdown in 5 sec by showing the message.
